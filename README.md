# GlobalHackathonApp
Welcome to our submission to the Virtual/Uber Global Hackathon!

Green, your eco-friendly ride rewarded.

Green is a revolutionary new way for cities to incentivize environmentally-friendly transportation.
Green will reward users with Green Points. Green Points are a virtual currency within the app that can be used as discounts at participating sustainable small buisnesses throughout any city with Green.
Buisnesses can promote themselves on Green by either using a Pay-Per-Click model or a flat advertising fee.
After taking public transportation, the user can scan one of our Green Stickers. Green stickers are placed in buses, light rail, and other locations where people are using public transportation, like in San Francisco Cable Cars or on the Atlanta Streetcar.
Green will also reward people for taking rideshare with companies like Uber, and renting ebikes and escooters with companies like Lime or Spin.
Green is the easiest way for cities to promote environmentally-friendy transportation and small buisnesses without lifting a finger.
