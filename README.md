# GlobalHackathonApp
**Welcome to our submission to the Virtual/Uber Global Hackathon!**

**Green, your eco-friendly ride rewarded.**

Green is a revolutionary new way for cities to incentivize environmentally-friendly transportation.
Green will reward users with Green Points. Green Points are a virtual currency within the app that can be used as discounts at participating sustainable small buisnesses throughout any city with Green.
Buisnesses can promote themselves on Green by either using a Pay-Per-Click model or a flat advertising fee.
After taking public transportation, the user can scan one of our Green Stickers. Green stickers are placed in buses, light rail, and other locations where people are using public transportation, like in San Francisco Cable Cars or on the Atlanta Streetcar.
Green will also reward people for taking rideshare with companies like Uber, and renting ebikes and escooters with companies like Lime or Spin.
Green is the easiest way for cities to promote environmentally-friendy transportation and small buisnesses without lifting a finger.

About Green's Development:

Green is coded in Swift, with some framework helpers (using Cocoapods) coded in Ruby

Using Green:

To start using Green, simply log in with your Uber login credentials and/or Lime account phone number. The dashboard shows how many points you currently have, with links to the QR Scanner, Green Site Map, Achievements Page, and Settings Page. 

Currently, due to Uber API restraints, Uber rides may not appear immediately show up as points in your Green account, but you can still scan the QR codes to earn points! The Map Page shows a location in NYC with example sustainable businesses, but in future versions, with more cities implemented by Uber, this would show the user's location and local businesses.
